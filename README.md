# Getting Started with Create React App

## Hello dear Sina

This is a test project that the company wanted. I have done everything you requested except for the UI library.

I used Chakra UI and I suggest you at least read the documentation for this library. In my opinion, Chakra is better than Ant Design or other libraries for the following reasons:

    1.Customization

    2.Theming 

    3.Responsive 

    4.Documentation 

Additionally, Chakra results in a smaller final bundle size when built, which is important.

Please let me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to discuss my choice of Chakra further.
